# R Programming - Assignment 1: Air Pollution

In this assignment, we received a corpus of some three hundred odd CSV files
with data from air pollution monitors. No idea if they were real data or 
just made up.

## Part 1: Pollutant mean

Write a function which calculates the mean of all available (ie non-NA) 
measurements from the given monitors. 

## Part 2: Complete cases

Report on how many "complete" measurements (including all data for a given
measurement) exist for the monitors given.

## Part 3: Correlation

Calculate the correlations between the pollutantsn from a given set of monitors 
that contain a given minimum amount of comlpete measurements.
